<div class="story-flow">

  <div class="story-strip">
    I still remember our school days.<br>
    Back then, I never thought this would become us.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    Sir and student…<br>
    maybe it sounds strange to say now.<br>
    But that’s how it began.<br>
    Not planned. Not expected.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    I remember you following me.<br>
    Trying to talk.<br>
    Trying to impress me with your words.<br>
    And sometimes with chocolates.<br>
    I used to notice… even when I pretended not to.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    Then one day, you proposed.<br>
    I didn’t know what to say.<br>
    I needed time.<br>
    After six months, I finally said yes —<br>
    with a photo,<br>
    and feelings I couldn’t explain properly.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    After that, everything slowly changed.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    Chats that never felt boring.<br>
    Small chit-chats.<br>
    Calls that went longer than planned.<br>
    Those secret hugs in classrooms<br>
    that made my heart beat faster.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    Then 10th class came.<br>
    Life became heavy.<br>
    Family problems.<br>
    Silence.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    For six months, I didn’t talk to you.<br>
    But you were still there.<br>
    Waiting near my school gate.<br>
    Watching from a distance.<br>
    Following me everywhere.<br>
    Loving me without asking anything back.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    After my 10th,<br>
    when I spoke to you again…<br>
    it felt like breathing properly after a long time.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    PUC days brought new memories.<br>
    Our first outing — Vizag.<br>
    I still remember that feeling.<br>
    Our first movie together — Ala Vaikuntapuramulo.<br>
    Small moments… but they stayed.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    Two years passed.<br>
    Slowly, both our parents accepted us.<br>
    What started quietly<br>
    became something everyone knew.<br>
    A happy family.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    And now…<br>
    here we are.<br>
    Thinking about marriage.<br>
    About a future together.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    When I look back,<br>
    I don’t see just events.<br>
    I see patience.<br>
    Waiting.<br>
    Care.<br>
    And a love that never left.
  </div>

  <div class="story-strip">
    This is our story.<br>
    Not perfect.<br>
    But real.<br>
    And it’s still going 🤍
  </div>
